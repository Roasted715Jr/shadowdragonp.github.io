			<h2>Welcome to Zawada</h2>
			<p>Zawada is spinoff of the popular rage-inducing, cheater-promoting, and braggart-creating game. Originally by Andrew McGovern, Zawada was created by ShadowDragon Studios. Same rules, same logic, different game!</p>
			<p>The rules are simple.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Each page shows you a riddle presented in paragraphs and/or pictures.</li>
				<li>Think of the answer to the riddle and type the url below in the web address bar:<br><br>https://shadowdragonp.github.io/portals/games/zawada/<strong>youranswer</strong>.html</li><br>
				<li>Replace <strong>youranswer</strong> with the answer you had in mind. This should be self-explanatory, but statistics show that 80% of the American population is "mentally challenged."</li>
				<li>If your answer is correct, the next level will appear. If not, you will be given a 404 error.</li>
				<li>The answer is usually never shown right off the bat. This game is meant to test your intelligence, so sometimes you will have to think outside of the box.</li>
				<br>
				<li>When you're ready, <strong>begin!</strong></li>
